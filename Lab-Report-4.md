# Lab Report 4 

__Log into ieng6__

Using the ssh command I can access my account on the ieng6 server. I used my search history in terminal to speed up the process instead of typing my entire login.

__Git Clone__

I used git clone to clone my fork of the lab7 repository on to the ieng6 server. I copy-pasted the github link to save time

__Run Tests__ 

To run the junit tests, I first used cd to change the directory to lab7. Then I used ls to see the name of the java file with the tests. And then copy pasted the commands to run the j unit tests from week 3. The output shows that one of the tests is failing

__Edit the Code__

I used the command nano to open and edit the ListExamples.java file. I then fixed the error in the last while loop of the code by switching index2+=1  to index1+=1 instead which should prevent the program from failing the tests. I used the key press ```<ctrl+x>``` to exit the file and then press ```<y>``` to confirm the chnanges.

__Rerun Tests__

I used same commands to rerun the tests as before. However, instead of copy pasting them this time I used the terminal history by pressing the up key repeatedly until I landed on the appropriate command.

Using git add, commit and push allows me to commit the changes to my file on my github account.
